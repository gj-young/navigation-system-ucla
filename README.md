# navigation-system-ucla
Navigation system centered around UCLA, implemented using breadth-first search. The user specifies a starting and ending location from the list of 600+ locations (found in validlocs.txt) and the program outputs step-by-step directions based on the calculated optimal route. 

Project idea from: 
- https://www.cs.ucla.edu/
Web provided files of geolocation data and useful formulas: 
- provided.h, validlocs.txt, and mapdata.txt

Parts that I implemented: 
- AttractionMapper.h/.cpp, MapLoader.h/.cpp, MyMap.h, Navigator.h/.cpp, SegmentMapper.h/.cpp  

Next steps (to be continued):
- Improving the search speed 
- Additional geolocations 
- Graphical user interface
